# JS Drum Kit

This is a web-based application that allows users to play different drum sounds using their keyboard. The keys 'A', 'S', 'D', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'J', 'K', and 'L' each correspond to a different drum sound. When a key is pressed, the corresponding drum sound is played.

## How It Works

The JavaScript code listens for a 'keydown' event and then plays the corresponding sound. It also adds a 'playing' class to the key that was pressed. This class is removed when the 'transitionend' event is fired, stopping the sound.
